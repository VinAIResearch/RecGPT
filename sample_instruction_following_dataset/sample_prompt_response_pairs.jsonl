It was a good story with an exciting plot. I plan on reading more work from the author in the future. The only problem was that my enjoyment of the book was constantly interrupted by bad punctuation and misspellings - commas in the wrong place, \"hut\" instead of \"but,\" and more. I noticed this at least every few pages. It makes me think that this book didn't go through a proper editing process; maybe they relied too much on spell-check rather than read the entire book through to make corrections.
